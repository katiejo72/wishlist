Notes For Later
---------------

- CSS
  * update with more of my own personal styling

- Validation
  * see Rails API for more options
  * be more thorough, particularly with email format validation
  * email validation - existing standard?

- Password
  * add further constraints: i.e. mixed case, special chars, etc.
    - we like secure passwords!

- DB
  * if you haven't done it yet, which you really should have, but
    if you haven't - change fname and lname to first_name and
    last_name
    ~ make sure it gets changed EVERYWHERE
